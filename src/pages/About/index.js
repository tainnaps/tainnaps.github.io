          <p>
            Hello! I am Tain√°, a brazilian Web Software Developer.
            My journey with programming has began throught electronics, when I used to write programs to microcontrollers using Assembly and C programming languages.
            Now days, I build web applications using React.js to the front-end and Node.js to the back-end.
            I am currently studying at Trybe and improving myself to develop applications that will be useful to other people.
            Feel free to see the projects I've done and contact me. Have a nice time!
